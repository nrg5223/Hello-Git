# Hello-Git
To help with learning Git
I'm Nick, a second-year Software Engineering Student at RIT.  Rock climbing, spikeball, and biking are my interests.  I just ordered a rubber duck for my desk; if I am learning and working hard by using Github, he will be sure to have had an earful by the end of the semester.
